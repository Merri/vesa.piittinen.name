This is a personal website made with the help of [Astro](https://astro.build) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

If you are interested on learning Astro feel free to copy code as you see fit. Nobody is going to come after you.

For more complex Astro projects you can check my GitHub profile page. I'm planning to have almost all of my sites
running on Astro eventually, and all of the source code will be available on GitHub.
