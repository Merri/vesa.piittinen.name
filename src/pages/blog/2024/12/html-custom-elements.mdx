This is a dump post of my current understanding of the HTML custom elements, and how to use them on React which recently
celebrated it's version 19 release with much improved support the custom elements (finally).

## Creating a custom element

Here is a TypeScript base which has one string attribute/property defined.

```ts
// src/customElements/my-custom-element.ts
export class MyCustomElement extends HTMLElement {
	#custom = ''

	constructor() {
		super()
	}

	static observedAttributes = ['custom'] as const

	attributeChangedCallback(
		name: (typeof MyCustomElement.observedAttributes)[number],
		oldValue: string | null,
		newValue: string | null
	) {
		if (oldValue !== newValue) {
			this[name] = newValue
			// + queue update
		}
	}

	get custom() {
		return this.#custom
	}

	set custom(value) {
		this.#custom = `${value}`
		// + queue update
	}

	connectedCallback() {
		// do stuff
	}

	disconnectedCallback() {
		// do stuff
	}
}

if (!customElements.get('my-custom-element')) customElements.define('my-custom-element', RangeInputs)
```

I think the custom element file should define it's elements. This makes things straightforward for importing a custom
element file which may or may not have multiple custom elements in a single file.

Defining the getters and setters makes life easier with React. Mapping `attributeChangedCallback` to use the properties
is a bit of a hack but in the other hand it does work in a neat way to initialize all the attributes to internal state.
This is something that I do need some more experience working with since I've had to do suprisingly few get/set
properties so far.

## Custom element CSS

Custom element related styles should be global, and in most cases it should always be loaded with the HTML page. Meaning
no lazy loading it. But your mileage may vary depending on the type of custom element you're working with. I'm mostly
working with "native-like" or "HTML web components", which means enhancing light DOM instead of working from the
shadows.

## Dynamic loading custom elements

It is often desirable to load JavaScript only if it is needed. This seems to be an area where everybody have their own
solution. So I have my own! This is my current loader implementation:

```ts
// src/customElements/dynamicImport.ts
let observer: MutationObserver | null = null

function unobserve() {
	observer?.disconnect()
	observer = null
}

/**
 * Loads HTML custom elements from a given import map dynamically as they are added to the page.
 *
 * Call a single time in code that is guaranteed to be included each time in the front-end payload a page.
 *
 * Note that you can do this outside your React app and make the custom elements load before React boots up.
 *
 * @returns Callback to end observing changes to DOM.
 */
export const dynamicImportCustomElements = ({ ...importMap }: Record<string, () => string[] | void | Promise<any>>) => {
	if (typeof window === 'undefined' || !('customElements' in window) || observer) return unobserve

	for (const key of Object.keys(importMap)) {
		if (customElements.get(key)) delete importMap[key]
	}

	let loadQueue: number | null = null

	/** Returns true if there is still something to import from the import map */
	function loadElements() {
		loadQueue = null
		const elements = new Set([...document.querySelectorAll(':not(:defined)')].map((el) => el.localName))

		for (let element of elements) {
			if (element in importMap) {
				const keys = importMap[element]()
				const list = new Set(Array.isArray(keys) ? [element, ...keys] : element)
				for (let key of list) {
					delete importMap[key]
				}
			}
		}

		if (Object.keys(importMap).length === 0) {
			unobserve()
			return false
		}

		return true
	}

	if (loadElements()) {
		observer = new MutationObserver(function (mutations) {
			if (loadQueue != null) return

			for (let { addedNodes } of mutations) {
				for (let node of addedNodes) {
					if (node instanceof HTMLElement && node.localName in importMap) {
						loadQueue = requestAnimationFrame(loadElements)
						return
					}
				}
			}
		})

		observer.observe(document.documentElement, { childList: true, subtree: true })
	}

	return unobserve
}
```

It does quite a few things!

1. It doesn't execute on server side context if you somehow attempt to do that.
2. It ignores any already defined custom elements.
3. It immediately loads any undefined (`:not(:defined)`) custom elements should they currently be found in DOM.
4. It listens for DOM changes to any opportunity to load new custom elements.
5. It stop listening the DOM if all known elements on the list have been loaded.

You might remember from above that I mentioned a single file may have multiple elements defined. But `importMap` only
allows for one element name! How can it load correct file only once for a file that has multiple elements defined?

```ts
dynamicImportCustomElements({
	'my-custom-element': () => {
		import('./customElements/my-custom-element')
		return ['my-custom-element', 'my-custom-element-2']
	},
	'my-custom-element-2': () => {
		import('./customElements/my-custom-element')
		return ['my-custom-element', 'my-custom-element-2']
	},
})
```

By returning a string array you can define which elements are related to the file. I don't know yet if this is "the
best" nor even real-life working way to do this. Another option would be to allow for comma separated list in the keys.
That way the list would be one key, one file, and would have less repetition.

Also there is the topic of code splitting and I'm not going to think about that today.

## Placement of dynamic loading

I think the best goal is to load custom elements as soon as possible.

Have a custom element that is very likely to be on every page? Always load it immediately!

Otherwise? Add dynamic loader before the main app client-side bootstrap. Yes, even before React mounts/hydrates.

My thinking is that since for me custom elements are "native-like" and make use of progressive enhancement it makes no
sense to wait for React to get to a point that it has rendered everything and only then start loading the JS of a custom
element. That is way too late!

So a simple rule: `useEffect()` should not be used for loading a custom element.

Besides: React is super slow to boot. Usually custom elements can start reacting immediately upon their code has been
parsed in browser giving a much more responsive experience to user. React instead will have additional hydration
check-up phase to get that virtual DOM thing going on before any state can change. That will always be slower regardless
of the level of React optimizations.

## Typing JSX

It was suprisingly hard to find information on how custom elements should be typed. In the end I had to experiment on my
own because it seems a lot of the search results on search engines like Google will point to very... uh... interesting
results!

So I have these two files:

```ts
// src/customElements/react.ts
import type { HTMLAttributes, Ref } from 'react'

export type ReactJsxCustomElement<T> = Omit<HTMLAttributes<T>, 'className' | 'htmlFor'> & {
	class?: string
	for?: string
	ref?: Ref<T>
}
```

```ts
// src/customElements/reactJsxTypes.d.ts
import { MyCustomElement } from './my-custom-element'
import { ReactJsxCustomElement } from './react'

interface ReactJsxMyCustomElement extends ReactJsxCustomElement<MyCustomElement> {}

// for NextJS you need to do the same but for global JSX namespace due to tsconfig having a JSX setting as "preserve"
export interface ReactJsxCustomElements {
	'my-custom-element': ReactJsxMyCustomElement
}

// React 19?
declare module 'react' {
	namespace JSX {
		interface IntrinsicElements extends ReactJsxCustomElements {}
	}
}

// React 18?
declare module 'react/jsx-runtime' {
	namespace JSX {
		interface IntrinsicElements extends ReactJsxCustomElements {}
	}
}
```

As you can see I'm still wondering about things a bit. In a React 18 based Storybook project typing JSX got bonkers if I
added global JSX types so I could only use `react/jsx-runtime`. Maybe there is something wrong in that project's config,
but I don't know if I want to spend time to figure it out.

Regardless it seems in React 19 the JSX types are now in the `react` module. Though maybe it all depends on the project
and tool you're working with... really don't like how it seems it's always a bit different. I won't complain about
NextJS this time around. It is what it is.

Anyway with these types it becomes possible to use the custom element in a React TypeScript project. And the types seem
to be actually correct. Woohoo!

## React component vs custom element

I think anything that depends a lot on DOM should be implemented as an HTML custom element first. For me React these
days is just a syntactic sugar layer, a tool of developer convenience rather than the place where the most serious web
front-end code should be in.

A lot of styling should also be solved in global CSS rather than "localize everything" mentality that React often seems
to delve in. By making good use of native HTML elements and creating good global CSS-based utilities you can really save
a lot of development pain. Adding in HTML custom elements you can even move some hard state management and ownership
away from the React machine, especially for elements that can work independently.

## Something more complete

<Link href="https://muffinman.io/blog/native-dual-range-input/">
	<>Stanko recently released a native dual-range input</>
</Link>
<> which I found interesting.</>

First I got interested on making it work for more than just two range inputs, porting it over from Sass to vanilla CSS
and from vanilla JS to a custom element:

<Codepen id="MYgKrJV" title="<range-inputs> HTML custom element (dev version, see StackBlitz for more polish)" />

But since I have been working on getting into the custom element world during this latter part of the year I also wanted
to get some of the solutions I have gained in my job out to the public side, so, what you have now see as this post.

Thus I ended up making a project to <Link href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-udntz7">StackBlitz</Link> which
has all of the stuff I've been talking on this blog post but applied to a practical project.

The project is a SPA only though, and I usually work with hydrated HTML. Though the code should work for both use cases.

There would be so much more to test and check on that project and I don't even have an immediate need for a dual range
input so I don't know if I ever bother to complete this much farther than this.

But hey, now this information is out here for you to enjoy. Maybe it helps solve some stuff for you.
