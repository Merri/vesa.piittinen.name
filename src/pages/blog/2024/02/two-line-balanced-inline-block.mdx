Hey #CSS folks...

Anybody know how to pull off a box like this:

-   two lines of text, balanced (equal words per line)
-   min-width of say 12 chars, text on one-line if lower char count
-   feels like an inline-block
-   box doesn't grow in size to fit text on one line

<img

	width="731"
	height="172"
/>

As things are this is **impossible** to achieve reliably with current CSS: we have no tools to force a box to shrink so
that it attempts to size itself to always result into two lines of text. So let us go through the closest matches!

## The restrictions

"Feels like `inline-block`" was mentioned in the quote above. The issue with it is that when inline block has text long
enough to wrap to multiple lines it will take all the available space. We can't force it to take the least space
available when wrapping.

The closest rule that we get by technical functionality is the old
proprietary <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/-webkit-line-clamp">-webkit-line-clamp</Link>
which has been implemented in all browsers, but it doesn't do what we want: while you can use it to tell how many lines
of text you want to see, it achieves this by truncating the extra away and adding three ellipses if it does so.

Then we have `min-content` value. The problem with it is that it wraps to absolute minimum width:

<span style="border: thin solid; display: inline-block; padding: 4px; width: min-content;">I'm a Hello World box</span>

You could overcome this issue by selectively placing non-breaking spaces:

```html
I'm&nbsp;a&nbsp;Hello World&nbsp;box
```

<br />
<span style="border: thin solid; display: inline-block; padding: 4px; width: min-content;">
	<span>I'm&nbsp;a&nbsp;Hello World&nbsp;box</span>
</span>

... but that would either mean extra manual work for the people writing content, or writing a piece of server code that
would determine where to keep the regular space.

So, are we done? We have a solution, albeit not a very CSS one.

## Duplicate it!

Of course, me being the "if it is possible to be done in CSS I will make it happen" sort of guy, I did manage to find a
solution to this problem. And of course it is a hacky solution since we are talking about something CSS doesn't have.

The idea is to have the text in DOM twice: one is for visual representation, but another is added in half the size and
that would determine the minimum width of the box when using `fit-content`. The half-size text would have
`white-space: nowrap`.

Here is the minimal implementation of that idea, keeping the text visible so you can see what is happening:

```html
<span style="border: thin solid; display: inline-block; padding: 4px; width: min-content;">
	<span style="display: block; font-size: 50%; white-space: nowrap;">I'm a Hello World box</span>
	<span>I'm a Hello World box</span>
</span>
```

<br />
<span style="border: thin solid; display: inline-block; padding: 4px; width: min-content;">
	<span style="display: block; font-size: 50%; white-space: nowrap;">I'm a Hello World box</span>
	<span>I'm a Hello World box</span>
</span>

Very much a success! There is a bit of extra space to the right but that usually isn't an issue as long as we have
roughly the right width for the box. However the above trick doesn't work as intended for all the cases:

<span style="border: thin solid; display: inline-block; padding: 4px; width: min-content;">
	<span style="display: block; font-size: 50%; white-space: nowrap;">Web Components are the best</span>
	<span>Web Components are the best</span>
</span>

There are multiple ways to try fix this issue:

1. Write a regular expression that replaces space with `&nbsp;` when there is a combination of short + long word at
   beginning and end of the text.

    <span style="border: thin solid; display: inline-block; padding: 4px; width: min-content;">
    	<span style="display: block; font-size: 50%; white-space: nowrap;">Web Components are the best</span>
    	<span>Web&nbsp;Components are the best</span>
    </span>

2. Adjust the small text to take more space.

    <span style="border: thin solid; display: inline-block; padding: 4px; width: min-content;">
    	<span style="display: block; font-size: 50%; text-indent: 4.5ex; white-space: nowrap;">
    		<span>Web Components are the best</span>
    	</span>
    	<span>Web Components are the best</span>
    </span>

3. Use soft hyphens.

    <span style="border: thin solid; display: inline-block; padding: 4px; width: min-content;">
    	<span style="display: block; font-size: 50%; white-space: nowrap;">Web Components are the best</span>
    	<span>Web Compo&shy;nents are the best</span>
    </span>

The first fix is almost good enough for almost every case since the problem does happen mostly when there is not enough
text.

The second fix helps with the issue, but has the downsize of adding even more empty space to the right side of the box.

The third fix can also help with the issue by breaking the text to smaller parts, however the added hyphen does take a
bit more space so you should account for that (by also using the second fix).

Combine these fixes and you are likely to get very close to never seeing three lines of text!

## Making it good for production

We now have the technical wrapping very close to that we want, but we are not really good for production. The main
issues we currently face are related to the duplicate text:

1. It effects our layout.
2. It is accessible.
3. It can be read by a screen reader too.

There are also other cases we have not yet accounted for:

1. Limiting to a maximum width of 100%.
2. Preventing horizontal scrollbars in limited space.

To demonstrate the issues here is a simulation of what happens in limited space:

<div data-scrolling="inline" data-color="contrast" style="padding: 16px; max-width: 320px;">
	<p>This is some lorem ipsum without it being lorem ipsum so that you can see how this text wraps.</p>
	<span style="border: thin solid; display: inline-block; font-size: 4rem; padding: 4px; width: min-content;">
		<span style="display: block; font-size: 50%; text-indent: 4.5ex; white-space: nowrap;">
			Web Components are the best
		</span>
		<span>Web Components are the best</span>
	</span>
</div>

The desire to go for two lines of text has become too extreme here: we would rather want the text to wrap to more than
two lines than to cause a horizontal scrollbar to appear.

### Hiding the smaller text

We can effectively hide the 50% text with `visibility: hidden`, and remove the effect to layout with `height: 0`:

<span style="border: thin solid; display: inline-block; padding: 4px; width: min-content;">
	<span style="display: block; font-size: 50%; height: 0; text-indent: 4.5ex; visibility: hidden; white-space: nowrap;">
		<span>Web Components are the best</span>
	</span>
	<span>Web Components are the best</span>
</span>

This also removes the text from screen reader, but just to be sure we can also make use of `inert` attribute on HTML
side to be perfectly sure the element will not be part of any other use than to be the measure of minimum width.

### Limiting the width and preventing scrollbars

The problem with `white-space: nowrap` is that the text still takes all the space it needs even if we don't see it, and
this will be a source of (sometimes mystical feeling) horizontal scrollbars. To counter it we can use `contain: content`
on the parent element.

Finally, to allow the parent element to be smaller than `min-content` we can use `max-width: 100%`. The following has
all the new changes applied:

<div data-scrolling="inline" data-color="contrast" style="padding: 16px; max-width: 320px;">
	<p>This is some lorem ipsum without it being lorem ipsum so that you can see how this text wraps.</p>
	<h4 style="color: inherit">4rem</h4>
	<span style="border: thin solid; contain: content; display: inline-block; font-size: 4rem; max-width: 100%; padding: 4px; width: min-content;">
		<span
			inert
			style="display: block; font-size: 50%; height: 0; text-indent: 4.5ex; visibility: hidden; white-space: nowrap;"
		>
			<span>Web Components are the best</span>
		</span>
		<span>Web Components are the best</span>
	</span>
	<h4 style="color: inherit">3rem</h4>
	<span style="border: thin solid; contain: content; display: inline-block; font-size: 3rem; max-width: 100%; padding: 4px; width: min-content;">
		<span
			inert
			style="display: block; font-size: 50%; height: 0; text-indent: 4.5ex; visibility: hidden; white-space: nowrap;"
		>
			<span>Web Components are the best</span>
		</span>
		<span>Web Components are the best</span>
	</span>
	<h4 style="color: inherit">2rem</h4>
	<span style="border: thin solid; contain: content; display: inline-block; font-size: 2rem; max-width: 100%; padding: 4px; width: min-content;">
		<span
			inert
			style="display: block; font-size: 50%; height: 0; text-indent: 4.5ex; visibility: hidden; white-space: nowrap;"
		>
			<span>Web Components are the best</span>
		</span>
		<span>Web Components are the best</span>
	</span>
</div>

Hurrah, no horizontal scrollbar! We could still polish the visual end result with the fresh `text-wrap: balance`.

Here is a more complete sample to play around with:

## Use cases

There is one place where this kind of behavior could be desirable: buttons!

<div data-box="row" style="text-wrap: balance;">
	<button type="button" style="max-width: 100%; flex: 0 min-content;">
		<span>
			<span
				inert
				style="display: block; font-size: 50%; height: 0; text-indent: 1.625rem; visibility: hidden; white-space: nowrap;"
			>
				<span>See more</span>
			</span>
			<span>See more</span>
		</span>
	</button>
	<button type="button" style="max-width: 100%; flex: 0 min-content;">
		<span>
			<span
				inert
				style="display: block; font-size: 50%; height: 0; text-indent: 1.625rem; visibility: hidden; white-space: nowrap;"
			>
				<span>Confirm choices</span>
			</span>
			<span>Confirm choices</span>
		</span>
	</button>
	<button type="button" style="max-width: 100%; flex: 0 min-content;">
		<span>
			<span
				inert
				style="display: block; font-size: 50%; height: 0; text-indent: 1.625rem; visibility: hidden; white-space: nowrap;"
			>
				<span>Activate my account</span>
			</span>
			<span>Activate my account</span>
		</span>
	</button>
	<button type="button" data-button="canvasColor mediumSize negative" style="max-width: 100%; flex: 0 min-content;">
		<span>
			<span
				inert
				style="display: block; font-size: 50%; height: 0; text-indent: 1.625rem; visibility: hidden; white-space: nowrap;"
			>
				<span>Destroy the world as we know it</span>
			</span>
			<span>Destroy the world as we know it</span>
		</span>
	</button>
	<button type="button" data-button="canvasColor mediumSize positive" style="max-width: 100%; flex: 0 min-content;">
		<span>
			<span
				inert
				style="display: block; font-size: 50%; height: 0; text-indent: 1.625rem; visibility: hidden; white-space: nowrap;"
			>
				<span>I agree to all of your shenanigans</span>
			</span>
			<span>I agree to all of your shenanigans</span>
		</span>
	</button>
	<a
		href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iik25wqIuFo"
		target="_blank"
		rel="nofollow noopener"
		data-button="canvasColor mediumSize"
		style="max-width: 100%; text-align: center; flex: 0 min-content;"
	>
		<span>
			<span
				inert
				style="display: block; font-size: 50%; height: 0; text-indent: 2.375rem; visibility: hidden; white-space: nowrap;"
			>
				<span>This link pretends to be a button</span>
			</span>
			<span data-text="external link">This link pretends to be a button</span>
		</span>
	</a>
</div>

Usually with buttons you have to resort to a mixture of specifically designed widths and agreements with localization
folks for certain length of text so that you can get a desired visual end result.

With this solution you can tell your designer that hey, we can actually now do this with some dirty HTML and CSS
trickery. You have to be careful for the designer not to fall in love with you so make sure to ruin their day with
something else to maintain safe boundaries.
