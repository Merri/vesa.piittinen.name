One of the problems that comes your way every now and then is the need to display an image only in some viewport sizes.

A naive solution to this problem would be to apply `dislay: none;` or a similar CSS. The issue with that: the image will
still be loaded by the browser.

Or maybe you could apply the image as a background via CSS! But then you get into all the issues with how verbose the
syntax can get and how hard it is to load only the ideal image &ndash; and browser may still load all those various
variants of the image, not only the one it needs.

This is why we have responsive images. However one of the lacking features in them is to not load an image in some
cases. The workaround for this is to use a traditional 1&times;1 pixel image which has been called with names like
`transparent.gif`, `blank.gif`, or `spacer.gif` when having it as a separate file.

For this use case however we want to have the image as a data URL to make it inlined to HTML. This way we can avoid an
extra request over the network and have a short repeating piece of code that gets effectively compressed.

But often the first thought in this case is to just look up the smallest (GIF) file and convert that into a data URL.
There, solved? Unfortunately things are not that easy if you want to really, really have it the smallest it can be! You
can make data URLs in multiple ways: you may use base64 for you could use URL encoding. Base64 is often the way for
binary files while URL encoding may work nicely for text based file formats like SVG.

So a few months ago I went ahead and did research on this particular topic. I wanted to find the image with the
following criteria:

1. It is as tiny as possible
2. It results in as tiny data URL as possible
3. It works in all browsers

Here is the pen. Image border is red if it fails.

<Codepen id="eYadLoW" title="Goal: find a smallest working data URL for srcset when image is not displayed in mobile" />

Make sure to check the pen on different browser engines as of the above conditions especially the third part is a
greatly limiting factor! While you can find a GIF file as small as 14 bytes (33 bytes as data URL) that works on Chrome,
it won't work for Safari or Firefox.

Out of all the options I ended up with a surprising result: the smallest data URL is a BMP! This is the top three of the
images that loaded on all browsers:

|                                                               Image                                                                | Data URL                                                           | File size |      URL size | Format |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------: | ------------: | :----- |
|  <img height="24" width="24"  alt="smallest-data-url.bmp" src="data:image/bmp;base64,Qk0eAAAAAAAAABoAAAAMAAAAAQABAAEAGAB4eXoA"/>   | `data:image/bmp;base64,Qk0eAAAAAAAAABoAAAAMAAAAAQABAAEAGAB4eXoA`   |  30 bytes | 62 characters | BMP    |
| <img height="24" width="24"  alt="smallest-data-url.webp" src="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRhYAAABXRUJQVlA4TAoAAAAvAAAAAEX/I/of"/>  | `data:image/webp;base64,UklGRhYAAABXRUJQVlA4TAoAAAAvAAAAAEX/I/of`  |  30 bytes | 63 characters | WebP   |
| <img height="24" width="24"  alt="smallest-data-url.svg" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'/%3E" /> | `data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'/%3E` |  41 bytes | 64 characters | SVG    |

Of these the SVG is the best when you need a transparent image. As for BMP, here is a generator to customize the color.

## Smallest BMP data URL generator

Pick a color from the color input.

<smallest-bmp-generator style="align-items: center; display: flex; gap: 16px; flex-flow: wrap;">
	<label>
		<>Color:</>
		<input type="color" value="#7A7978" />
	</label>
	<code>
		<>data:image/bmp;base64,</>
		<output>Qk0eAAAAAAAAABoAAAAMAAAAAQABAAEAGAB4eXoA</output>
	</code>
	<img width="32" height="24" alt="" src="data:image/bmp;base64,Qk0eAAAAAAAAABoAAAAMAAAAAQABAAEAGAB4eXoA" />
</smallest-bmp-generator>

<SmallestGIF />

As a conclusion: boy does it get hard to write a blog about something when you don't find the time to do it regularly.
