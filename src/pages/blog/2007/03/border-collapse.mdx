import { hiddenCell, tableCell, tableWithBorderCollapse } from './border-collapse.module.css'

This is a very old bug testcase page from year 2007.

## `border-collapse : collapse;` CSS bugs with tables

<table class={tableWithBorderCollapse}>
	<tr>
		<th class={hiddenCell}>This cell should not be visible.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class={tableCell}>This cell should be surrounded by a single 1px red border.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

What we have above is a regular table with two cells: the first one has been hidden while the other is visible. border-collapse : collapse; has been applied and borders of 1px added to both table and cells. However, both Firefox and IE render the table incorrectly: Firefox doesn't render the borders at all while Internet Explorer renders the border of the hidden cell.

```html
<table class="tableWithBorderCollapse">
	<tr>
		<th class="hiddenCell">This cell should not be visible.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tableCell">This cell should be surrounded by a single 1px red border.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
```

This bug exists in Firefox up to version 2 and in Internet Explorer versions 5 to 7.

### How to resolve?

In this case you could resolve the bug by hiding the entire row instead.

## Opera bug

Below is another table with four cells: the first one is hidden while the other ones are visible.

<table class={tableWithBorderCollapse}>
	<tr>
		<th class={hiddenCell}>This cell should not be visible.</th>
		<td class={tableCell}>This cell should be visible.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class={tableCell}>This cell should be visible.</td>
		<td class={tableCell}>This cell should be visible.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Opera renders only half of the top border of the table while it should render all of it. This bug exists in versions from Opera 7 to Opera 9.10.

```html
<table class="tableWithBorderCollapse">
	<tr>
		<th class="hiddenCell">This cell should not be visible.</th>
		<td class="tableCell">This cell should be visible.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="tableCell">This cell should be visible.</td>
		<td class="tableCell">This cell should be visible.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
```

### How to resolve?

You must have an empty cell in the table.
