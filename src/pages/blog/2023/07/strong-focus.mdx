import Icon from '$/components/Icon.astro'
import { inlineFlex } from '$/components/inlineFlex.module.css'
import styles from '$/css/strong-focus.module.css'

This is a summary on how I think about focus indicators, and how to solve pretty much all the issues around using them.

## Rule one

Focus indication should **always** be strong and highly visible.

<button style="outline: 3px solid var(--focus-color); outline-offset: 3px;">Strong!</button>

## Rule two

You should use the same indicator for everything. It should be a global style.

```css
:where(:focus:not(:focus-visible)) {
	outline: none;
}

:where(:focus:focus-visible) {
	outline: 3px solid Highlight;
	outline-offset: 3px;
}
```

<details>
	<summary>Are they the same?</summary>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p class={inlineFlex} style="gap: 32px; margin: 16px;">
				<button style="outline: 3px solid var(--focus-color); outline-offset: 3px;">Button: same!</button>
				<a style="outline: 3px solid var(--focus-color); outline-offset: 3px;">Link: same!</a>
				<input
					readonly
					style="outline: 3px solid var(--focus-color); outline-offset: 3px;"
					value="Input: same!"
				/>
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</details>

## Rule three

Focused elements should have a style that pushes them above the others in a group or a list:

1. `position: relative;` works for many regular cases.
2. `transform: translateX(0);` can also be enough to push above, but sometimes subpixels are nasty.
3. `z-index: 1;` when out of options.

```css
/* make focused element be above the others */
.someElement:focus {
	transform: translateX(0);
}
```

## Rule four

Focus indicator should never clip. On a container either use `contain: layout;` over `overflow: hidden;`, or if you must
have a `contain: content;` (= `overflow: hidden;`) then use negative margin + padding trick to increase the size of the
drawn container.

<div class={inlineFlex} style="gap: 32px;">
	<div class={styles.poorContainment}>
		<button style="outline: 3px solid var(--focus-color); outline-offset: 3px;">
			Clipping <Emoji as="⛔" />
		</button>
		<br />
		<span>Sad</span>
	</div>
	<div class={styles.betterContainment}>
		<button style="outline: 3px solid var(--focus-color); outline-offset: 3px;">
			Visible! <Emoji as="✔️" />
		</button>
		<br />
		<span>Happy</span>
	</div>
	<div>

```css
/* If you do also need the padding: */
.container {
	background-clip: padding-box;
	border: 1rem solid tranparent;
	margin: -1rem;
}
```

    </div>

</div>

And if this is too hard, move the focus indicator inside:

```css
.container > *:focus-visible {
	outline-offset: -6px;
}
```

But you may also need to adjust the indicator color.

## Rule five

Clearly visible focus indicator is more important than visual attractiveness.

If you try to design a focus indicator to be pretty you are likely making it less noticeable. That is wrong. It must be
visually annoying.

Do not apply a continuous animation on a focus indicator. Focus indicator should be highly visible on itself and adding
continuous animation on an already highly visible element can cause motion sickness or headache. It can also be
confusing to a person with very limited vision since focus indicators usually do not animate continously.

## Tip one

If you have a card element it can be cleaner to have focus indicator on the whole card even when the clickable area is
only a button. You can achieve this with a pseudo element on the button:

```css
.card {
	position: relative;
	/* or this is enough as well: */
	container-type: inline-size;
}

.card button:focus {
	outline: none;
}

.card button:focus-visible::before {
	content: '';
	inset: 0;
	pointer-events: none;
	position: absolute;
	outline: 3px solid Highlight;
	outline-offset: 3px;
}
```

By removing `pointer-events: none;` you can also make the whole card clickable. Also, you can use `:focus-within` on the
card element to make sure the outline appears above the other cards.

<div class={inlineFlex} style="align-items: flex-start;">
	<div class={styles.card}>
		<strong>A Card</strong>
		<p>Focus me with keyboard</p>
		<button>Do it!</button>
	</div>
	<div class={styles.card}>
		<strong>B Card</strong>
		<p>Oh no leave me alone</p>
		<button>Don't come here</button>
	</div>
	<div class={styles.card}>
		<strong>C Card</strong>
		<p>You focused B didn't you?</p>
		<button>Of course</button>
	</div>
</div>

## Tip two

Make use of CSS custom properties: define a `--focus-color`. When used in a local theme system you can make sure that
most of the time your focus color works well regardless of background. At minimum you could have a team rule to adjust
the CSS variable instead of copy-pasting all the focus indicator styles only to change the indicator color.

Alternate to this option is to use two contrasting colors such as pure black and white, however making this work can be
tricky. You could use `box-shadow`, but it doesn't work well with a default global style since things such as cards can
often have a shadow, which would be a style conflict.
