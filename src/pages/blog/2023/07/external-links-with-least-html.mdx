title: External links with the least HTML
description: These days we have the need to display links to external sites with an accompanying icon. Typical implementations involve adding lots of extra elements under the hood. Is there a way to get it done with less?

Accessible external links is a recommended pattern in the modern web. These do not only benefit users with screen
readers by providing expectations, but have become a general good usability pattern to also let all users know that the
link will take them elsewhere.

## The requirements

For an external link you need the following:

-   The link itself
-   `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
-   `target="_blank"`
-   A way for user to know the link is an external link

This can seem simple enough at first. However there are some implementation details that are challenging to account for:

1. Typically external link is signaled with a dedicated icon. However this icon should never wrap to a new line alone.
2. For a screen reader user an icon is not enough. You need to have text somewhere that a screen reader can find it.

Additionally it would be desirable that the text content announcing the external link remains the same. On many
component based libraries and frameworks this might not be that much of a problem, you could just make the same text
repeat on each occasion. But even then it can be beneficial to not repeat the same text contents each time in the output
HTML / DOM. We'll return to this later on.

## Typical implementation

As far as I can tell a typical React-based implementation usually ends up being something like this after several
rounds of trial and error + life on actual production environment:

```jsx
import type { ComponentPropsWithoutRef } from 'react'

interface Props extends Omit<ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'a'>, 'target'> {
	href: string;
}

export function ExternalLink({ children, ...props }: Props) {
	// retain only lower case unique values
	const rel = [...new Set(`noopener noreferrer ${props.rel || ''}`.toLowerCase().trim().split(/\s+/))].join(' ')

	return (
		<a {...props} rel={rel} target="_blank">
			{children}
			<span style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>
				&#xfeff;
				<some-svg-based-icon style={{ marginLeft: '0.25rem' }} />
			</span>
			<span className={visuallyHidden}>Link to external site, opens a new browser window</span>
		</a>
	)
}
```

The sample above has been simplified slightly to use inline styles to make things slightly quicker to follow, in a real
component you'd use CSS Modules or other flavor of styling.

So, why do people eventually end up with that? Lets break it up!

### Visually hidden text

At the end we have the text to let screen readers know what the whole thing is about. We want the text to be read after
everything else so that is where we place it. Also, as `aria-label` does not translate on all tools the text is placed
in a visually hidden element.

Also, the element often ends up being the last element after someone notices they get a double gap when rendering the
external link as a button which happens to use `inline-flex` to align icons. You probably should have an entirely
different component for that render case but we won't delve too deep into that issue here.

### External link icon

One of the other first things people notice when using an icon at the end of a link is when they encountered a link at
the end of line: the icon ends up being treated as a separate character/word, and does a very ugly thing: it is
renderered alone into a new line! It would be much better if it was counted as a part of the last word, thus getting the
last word alongside the icon to a new line.

<figure>
	<div
		style="background: var(--shadow-bg); display: inline-block; font-size: 1.25rem; padding: 1rem; white-space: nowrap;"
		title="Simulated example of the problem"
	>
		<span>This is some inline text</span>
		<br />
		<a>and a link to nowhere</a>
		<br />
		<a>
			<Icon href="/icons/newscreen.svg" style="margin-left: 0.5rem" />
		</a>
		<span> and text goes on...</span>
	</div>
	<figcaption>Example of the problem</figcaption>
</figure>

So at this point people start to try it out and they usually find that a combination of `white-space: nowrap;` and a
`&nbsp;` character within a wrapping `<span />` does the magic to keep the icon and last word as a single unit. However
at some point a designer points out they don't want to see the underline get so close to the icon so `&nbsp;` gets
replaced by a margin on the icon and Unicode `0xFEFF` zero width no-break space. Or as HTML entity: `&#xfeff;`.

### Rel

The `rel` usually doesn't get all that much attention to it, but if there is a person with attention to code details you
end up getting some form of a solution that makes sure there are no duplicate attribute values on the list. And
enforcing `noopener` and `noreferrer` is better than trusting that the person giving a `rel` remembers to include
`noopener noreferrer` (relevant "naive" implementation being like: `rel={rel ?? 'noopener noreferrer'}`).

## The Good, The Bad

So, by now you hopefully understand why the typical React implementation is the way it is. What is good about it?

I guess one of the major good parts is how everything is in one place as a single component. This makes it easier to
follow stuff. Also the implementation works relatively well even when some unexpected stylings are applied, like making
the link element itself a flex container. Usually the icon and the text gets aligned in a desirable way.

However now we get to the bad parts. There is a lot of repetition happening: both the screen reader text and the icon
image itself are repeated over and over. This eats into HTML element budget and when it comes to client-side React it
also means there is more to do during renders. It just would be nicer to not have any extra HTML.

Finally there is also the part of "why?" when reading the code the first time. You need good comments and/or tests in
place to make sure the solution is not being refactored too eagerly by anyone! "This could be simpler and cleaner",
"that is unnecessary"... those thoughts are so easy to get when seeing something which isn't immediately obvious.

## If you only had HTML and CSS

The React component above is a good example of what happens when you think about a problem purely as a JavaScript
developer, as a consumer of a library, not as a web developer. So what would a web developer do? Well, they'd
investigate all the possibilities to avoid having those extra HTML elements. And they might even consider what it would
be like to write the same external link syntax over an over in cases where you don't have components, just HTML.

### Go HTML, go!

The first thing we can eliminate is the repeated visually hidden text. What we can do instead is to have a single
instance of this text in the DOM, say, at the beginning of body, and then use `aria-describedby` to get it read after
the link contents. While this is still repetition on every link it is easier to remember and easier to write!

```html
<body>
	<div id="link-to-external-site" hidden>Link to external site, opens in a new browser tab</div>

	<div>
		<a
			href="https://example.com"
			aria-describedby="link-to-external-site"
			rel="noopener noreferrer"
			target="_blank"
		>
			This is an example link
		</a>
	</div>
</body>
```

Wow, we didn't even need a visually hidden style here!

It is very common especially in the world of React mindset to avoid using fragmented solutions like the above. There is
just something that people dislike when a part of a solution is in a different place than the other. They want to
contain everything in the component. However the code above is very effective and simple!

**Disclaimer**: I do not have the resources to test this on an extensive list of screen readers and operating systems.
I have tested NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on iOS. Both announce the external link.

At this point we have zero added HTML elements. Can we also handle the icon without adding HTML?

### The enemy is weak, go CSS!

We know our requirements: inline element and no extra HTML to add. That doesn't leave a lot of options! And we should
still meet the criteria that the icon does not go to a new line alone. Is it even possible?

Turns out, yes it is! One little detail that I found out while doodling around this challenge is that padding of an
inline element never ends up to a new line alone! The only browser where it can do that, to my knowledge, is Samsung
Internet. And that I think is rare enough to not bother me.

However there is the challenge of having the icon only appear above the padding. There are a few ways to try to do that,
but sometimes a simple `position: absolute;` is the way to go:

```css
/* debug phase: try to show a box after all links */
a::after {
	background: currentColor;
	content: '';
	height: 1.25em;
	position: absolute;
	transform: translateX(0.1875rem);
	width: 1.25rem;
}
```

<figure>
	<div
		style="background: var(--shadow-bg); display: inline-block; font-size: 1.25rem; padding: 1rem; position: relative; overflow: hidden; resize: both;"
		title="Preview of the solution"
	>
		<span>This is some inline text </span>
		<span class={styles.exampleOne}>and a link to nowhere</span>
		<span> and text goes on...</span>
	</div>
	<figcaption>Resize: box should never be alone at start of new line</figcaption>
</figure>

That is a success! You should see the box always being attached to the last word of the link.

If you want a challenge there are still possibilities and open questions:

-   Is there any other way to achieve this same behavior? Borders?
-   What about `direction: rtl;`? Is it possible to make this actually work regardless of text direction?

### Polish it up with an icon

Finally we need to place an icon into the box. For that I've found mask images to be a decent way to get it done in a
reliable way:

```css
/* global SVG masks for CSS use */
:where(:root) {
	--mask-new-screen: url("data:image/svg+xml,<svg viewBox='0 0 24 24' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><path d='M20 4L9.99997 14M20 4L20 9.99999M20 4L14 3.99998M10 4H4V20H20V14' fill='none' stroke='black' stroke-width='2.5' stroke-linecap='round'/></svg>");
}

/* External links */
:where(a[target='_blank' i][rel~='noopener' i][rel~='noreferrer' i][aria-describedby]) {
	padding-right: 1.5rem;
}

/* External links */
:where(a[target='_blank' i][rel~='noopener' i][rel~='noreferrer' i][aria-describedby])::after {
	background: currentColor;
	content: '';
	height: 1.25em;
	position: absolute;
	width: 1.25rem;
	transform: translateX(0.1875rem);
	-webkit-mask-image: var(--mask-new-screen);
	mask-image: var(--mask-new-screen);
	-webkit-mask-position: bottom;
	mask-position: bottom;
	-webkit-mask-repeat: no-repeat;
	mask-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

**What do my eyes see here?!?** Global styles?! That is against the law!

You do you, but since external links do have this very specific syntax requirement I find it reliable enough to do it
through a global style. This is yet another hit to the heart of many "but that isn't a neatly contained component!"
folks. The truth is: this works, and it works mighty well. This is the implementation on <Link href="https://vesa.piittinen.name">my homepage</Link>.

> The icon is sourced from an old version of a Software Mansion Icon Pack, <Link href="https://swmansion.com" rel="nofollow">swmansion.com</Link>.

This styling is not entirely perfect for all desires: I chose to make it align well for regular size text, but on larger
sizes the icon might seem to be aligned too low related to the text. For now I'm happy enough with the result that I'm
keeping it as it is.

## The downsides and upsides

Life ain't perfect. This solution is just one clever way I got a desired result: minimal HTML implementation of an
external link with an icon with it being tied to the last word.

This is the full list of issues I'm aware of:

1. This is not extensively tested in the wild. I've tested this on a limited number of screen readers.
2. Samsung Internet does it's own interpretation of padding behavior on inline elements.
3. Text not written left-to-right is hard to support with this approach.
4. The solution is fragmented to "loose" dependencies: global CSS, global element with a specific `id` attribute.
5. The style breaks if you force the link element to be a flex or grid container.

However the benefits are quite huge!

1. HTML is as minimal as it can get. No extra elements for every link.
2. CSS has some mild complexity, but it isn't too bad.
3. Also less JS as a component. The complex stuff has moved entirely to CSS.

All in all, if you were a madman who would write stuff in pure HTML, this solution would be manageable! The way the
global CSS selectors are written do ensure that you get it right. You would notice if the external link icon didn't
appear.

### JavaScript implementation

Just in case it isn't obvious, the React component with a bit of documentation would look like this:

```tsx
import type { ComponentPropsWithoutRef } from 'react'

interface Props extends Omit<ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'a'>, 'target'> {
	href: string
}

/**
 * Renders a link with external link icon. CSS is in global styles. Icon is part of the last word in the link text and
 * wraps alongside it.
 *
 * Caveats:
 *
 * - You should only pass inline text as contents.
 * - Not compatible with flexbox or grid: the icon placement depends on block mode rendering. You have to change ::after
 *   pseudo element if you need the link as a flex or grid container.
 */
export function ExternalLink({ children, ...props }: Props) {
	// retain only lower case unique values
	const rel = [...new Set(`noopener noreferrer ${props.rel || ''}`.toLowerCase().trim().split(/\s+/))].join(' ')

	// external link description at top of body `<div id="link-to-external-site" hidden />`
	return (
		<a {...props} aria-describedby="link-to-external-site" rel={rel} target="_blank">
			{children}
		</a>
	)
}
```

With most components you also need to manage `className`, but when external link is implemented as global styles you
don't need to worry about it. Also, the implementation is now rather short and free of some complexity that existed in
the first React example above. You might even survive without writing tests against the component, the comments might be
enough.

Since we're now only dealing with HTML attributes you could even implement the logic entirely outside of a component:

```tsx
/**
 * Marks the link as an external link. CSS is in global styles. Icon is part of the last word in the link text and
 * wraps alongside it.
 *
 * Usage: put as last thing in props, for example `<a {...props} {...getExternalLinkProps(props.rel)}>`
 */
export const getExternalLinkProps = (rel?: string) => ({
	// localization at top of body: `<div id="link-to-external-site" hidden />`
	'aria-describedby': 'link-to-external-site',
	// retain only lower case unique values
	rel: [...new Set(`noopener noreferrer ${rel || ''}`.toLowerCase().trim().split(/\s+/))].join(' '),
	target: '_blank',
})
```

This can be a beneficial approach, and the code remains the same regardless of framework.

## Conclusion

External link icon is one of those cases that seems initially deceivingly simple, but often end up consuming far more
time than expected during implementation. I hope you like this take even if you're not implementing things exactly the
same way as shown in this article! I love to solve modern issues with tricks that are mostly from "the past ages of the
web", but... is it the past if it is practical and useful today?
