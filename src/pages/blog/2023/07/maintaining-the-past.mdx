title: Maintaining the past
description: One of the nasty parts of having a long internet presence is that you have all those old things still around. So, I preserved a quirks mode test page.

I have been on the internet for a long time. One of the things that I don't like is when things just disappear. Be it a
refactored site by a company or someone remaking their personal site, I really dislike when old links no longer work.

While I'm not perfect in preserving old URLs myself I tend do make sure I do maintain some backwards compatibility. So
now that I did write this site on Astro it did pose me a challenge: what to do with my old legacy
[DOCTYPE test page](/doctype)? The original was written by me in PHP apparently around 2010. Looking at the CSS style it
might be far older than that!

I ended up rewriting it in Astro. Although in a rather limited way, because Astro does not allow to change the DOCTYPE
in an easy fashion when rendering a component. So it is good old manually managed string templating. The page works now
just like it did before. And as an added bonus, for the first time, the source is also up on GitHub.

I have no idea if anyone finds this valuable anymore. We have had no need for quirks mode for a long time as HTML5 did
succeed any to my knowledge nobody is using other than `<!DOCTYPE html>` on their sites.
