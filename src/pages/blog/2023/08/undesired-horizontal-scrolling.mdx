I guess this is a pretty common issue: you have a website. You work on it and all is fine. Until suddenly you check your
phone, start scrolling the page and **BOOM!** your page is scrolling in all directions! Nooo! All that careful craft and
now everything is ruined!

Lets have a look at some solutions.

## Paint protection suit

There can be a lot of causes for horizontal scrollbars. Maybe you changed `box-sizing` to `content-box` and one of the
elements had `width: 100%;` and some padding. So the total width exceeds the available space. Or maybe some absolutely
positioned element draws slightly past the full width of the page. Or maybe content folks introduced a title text with a
very long word, didn't remember to add a soft hyphen (or they can't do that), and now that breaks the page in smallest
mobile sizes.

There is also one cause for this that can be extremely tricky to figure out: you do a `visually-hidden` trick but forget
to apply `overflow: hidden;` to the rules, and there is a sentence hidden with it. Looking at the element with browser
dev tools you see the element is 1&times;1 pixels like it is supposed to, but actually due to `white-space: nowrap;`
(which is a required style in this case) the text is a one long line which also affects the page width.

I want to congratulate everyone who have had to debug that cause when fixing horizontal scrolling.

## Dirty fixes

Of course you might not ever get into those issues because you've been clever and added `overflow-x: hidden;` or a
`contain: paint;` to your body element. Ha! No more pesky horizontal scrollbar, freedoooom!

But I'm a nasty guy who is here to tell you that this solution is like piling trash under a rug. Sure, it fixes the
immediate issue, but it also does something that I do want to argue is far worse: from that point on any developer or
content editor might accidentally add in something that is out of the view of an user, and **you might never find out
about the issue**.

The issue might happen only on a very specific viewport size none of your team members happens to check on just the
right place of the site. This is a very challenging part of responsive design, and the problem might be something that
makes a feature or content inaccessible to people, but they won't even know to complain since they can't see what is
missing. Not even know that something should be there.

This is why I have solved the problem in a different way: by applying a global
`overflow-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;` style. Now this one is sure to make people open their eyes and just
go full on "why? Why would you do that to yourself?"

## Breaking everything

I guess I have to defend the `break-word` solution. The major downside of this rule is that it breaks words in an ugly
way: if you don't have soft hyphens in words then the titles will look bad. However: a title with a word too wide will
still be readable instead of being clipped. Of course English language doesn't have a lot of very long words, but the
sites I work on have Finnish and we do have real words like Ã„teretsiputeretsipuolilautatsibaari (okay I admit this one
was just a name of a bar in Salla many years ago).

Another common issue when introducing this rule to an existing project is that usually many places in UI have their text
cut. However I'd argue these are places where CSS is buggy anyway: the layout should by default reserve enough space for
the text. Besides the lazy fix of `white-space: nowrap;` is easy enough to apply, at least until there is time for to do
a proper fix.

Now that we've gone though the issues I want to point out the biggest benefit of this solution over a
`overflow-x: hidden;` on body: instead of having hidden issues you might never find your issues are noticeable. Newly
made stuff will still make the horizontal scrollbar visible and thus be fixed during development. While this is annoying
it is much better than not knowing about an issue. Also: word breaking is highly visible and annoying issue that you
want to fix. And that is the point: you have issues that you can easily notice and fix immediately.

## Balanced text

A recent addition to Chromium based browsers has been `text-wrap: balance;` and it is a very nice addition. However
there is a downside as well: it doesn't play nice with `break-word`!

Let's say you have a title "Magnificent toy", but there is enough space only to have "Magnificent" entirely on the
first line. What will happen with balanced wrapping and `break-word`?

```
Magnific
ent toy
```

Well... That is undesirable. This might get fixed by applying soft hyphen to the longer word, but that isn't really an
ideal fix since this issue can happen pretty much anywhere.

So it seems the `text-wrap: balance;` implementation is rather naive and the line length calculation will apply with
`break-word`, ignoring the fact that the whole word would in normal conditions fit to the given line, and breaks it.

<Codepen id="wvRvOBE" title="text-wrap: balance; is broken with word-break: break-word;" />

Personally I consider this behavior a bug, even if it goes precicely as stated in specs (I don't know). If the word
would fit the line then it should not be broken even if `break-word` is active together with balanced text.

So far this has been the first real issue that I've encountered with this `break-word` strategy to aid in eliminating
unexpected horizontal scrollbars caused by text content. However you might still not want to have `break-word` because
you're English only and all your words are always short and nice and unlikely to be wider than the narrowest phone
viewport. Which is fine: I'm only bringing up this option to aid those who might find it useful for their project.

## Other strategies

One strategy that could be employed would be to have a test that would check a page for existance of a horizontal
scrollbar on main body. However that is a rather costly test as it doesn't scale well for checking an entire site in
multiple viewport sizes. Also the harm is usually mostly in touch devices where you want to keep the scrolling vertical
at all times for the main page content. On a desktop computer a horizontal scrollbar is most often just a minor visual
annoyance that doesn't ruin user experience at all.

In the end: it is more important that all content remain accessible even with unintended layout behavior happening
rather than &ndash; in worst case &ndash; entirely blocking user from accessing a feature or information. So maybe that
horizontal scrollbar isn't *that* bad of an issue that you must eliminate it with an `overflow-x: hidden;` on body.
