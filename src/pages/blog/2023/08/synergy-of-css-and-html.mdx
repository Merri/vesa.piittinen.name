You might've occasionally seen me complain about Styled Components (or runtime CSS-in-JS in general), or be grumpy
towards Tailwind. This might put off some people, especially those who either have put a lot of effort into learning
those tools, or who simply are easily bandwagoned into a cultish behavior where there are "them vs us".

Personally I don't care about hype and I'm always more into the practical, true value of a thing. And I really like more
looking at the big picture &ndash; at least every time that I can spare my mind a break from all the details! So here I
will first cover some tools that I think get things wrong from my perspective to give a contrasting point on why I think
synergic use of web standards is a better way to go.

## The trend of the past 10 years

When it comes to web technology there really is no beating HTML and CSS. And I think we've had enough of the fun going
all in with the "everything in JavaScript" mindset that started with Node and React 10 years ago. Especially the latter
created an expectation that "if it isn't available for React it doesn't exist". While this isn't entirely a true
statement it is pretty much how things felt like for many years. And worst of this is that React is in many ways
incompatible with the rest of the industry. What is in React stays in React.

This similar mindset has spilled over to other solutions as well, and I think both Styled Components and Tailwind are a
great example. It isn't that rare to hear about teams where writing CSS as per usual **is entirely forbidden** and you
can only write in their specified flavor of CSS-in-JS or in Tailwind. I let you decide how wise such a decision is.

Maybe the hard part about web standards such as HTML and CSS is that to gain some developer conveniences for larger and
longer term development you do want to have some tools to assist. And this is what we've got to aid us in the past ten
years in the form of extensive JavaScript tooling which simply didn't exist before. But while this tooling was growing
up we got these "midpoint solutions" to help us out which arguably made many of us take a turn to the wrong direction
for a while.

For example React is becoming more of a legacy tool each passing day as it so far has refused to admit it has got some
things wrong, and that it's greatest past asset of guaranteeing better cross-browser compatibility, even with Internet
Explorer, has died out. Innovations React now introduces are only innovative when you consider React, but not to the web
industry at large.

## Weakness of a lacking synergy

So I've mentioned the word "synergy". In the web context I would define this as something that makes use of finding
strengths in the technologies and then making use of those strengths to create solutions that are greater than the sum
of their parts.

This is an area where I find solutions like Styled Components and Tailwind truly lacking, both for different reasons. A
characteristic way to use Styled Components is to write components. Usually you end up having this kind of syntax:

```tsx
// Defined in a separate style file:
export const Container = styled.div``

// And used in a "normal" component file:
function Component({ children }: Props) {
	return <Container>{children}</Container>
}
```

The problem here? Semantics are lost. You don't immediately see that Container is a div element. And this is a general
React issue as well, not only a problem with Styled Components. You lack synergy here, because typically what you do end
up with is HTML, or a DOM element.

The problem is a bit less of an issue for commonly shared components, like maybe you have a Box component that you use
for most of the heavy lifting of layouts, and you know that it always by default renders as a div. That isn't a problem.

But with Styled Components you usually define lots and lots of different components with varying amount of styles. This
makes it impossible to immediately know what HTML elements are being rendered. You can check the final output, but it
can be very hard to match that with what you see in your JSX.

Then how about Tailwind? Tailwind only provides utility classes so it can't have the same problem! So what I think is
Tailwind's problem?

Tailwind has it's own limited subset of CSS that becomes gradually outdated as CSS improves. While Tailwind could and
probably does expand, it means that it continuously needs to expand it's own vocabulary. You can already notice the harm
this does to Tailwind's own homepage: it has to load an awful lot of styles and this does already harm the performance
of the site. Of course, you can optimize Tailwind on your site.

The weird thing I've noticed about Tailwind sites is that they often make an extensive use of mostly div soup. Meaning,
there is very little use of semantic markup. What is wrong? Well, the lack of synergy! Tailwind lets anyone do visual
layouts fast, and this speed it allows makes the focus go a bit too much in the favor of visual end results. So yes,
here I am arguing that a Tailwind developer does not consider their surroundings enough. Maybe there are some who do,
but not enough that I'd be convinced that Tailwind would have synergy with the web technology.

Finally, a common "issue" I notice with sites made with Styled Components and Tailwind is that they are based on doing a
reset: all elements begin with "nothing": no margins, one font, even buttons and inputs without a style. All styles must
be re-defined from scratch, you can't write a content page with semantic elements and expect it to be readable.

I also consider resets to lack synergy. They can be a good fit for writing a highly interactive app-like site, but most
sites aren't like that.

## Bringing in the synergy

I guess I've spent enough energy on tools that I don't give much value to. It is time to look into what I consider a
better approach to HTML and CSS, the synergic use of web standards!

Instead of resets I prefer normalizing CSS. This means that semantic elements retain their browser defaults where those
are useful, and you can write a meaningful page even with just those basic styles. A recent evolution from just
normalizing has been zero-class CSS frameworks such as <Link href="https://simplecss.org/">Simple.css</Link>. The idea
is just to provide a good starting point.

But why is this valuable? Because you can provide just a single CSS file from say, a component library, which can be
used on **any HTML page** and that will be enough to provide something that already looks like a company's or
organization's page even though you are only using bare semantic HTML. And it can look pretty already at that point.
This is very valuable for getting new projects started off faster as they don't need to spend time on figuring out the
basics. You have semantic HTML for content available right away!

However developers often do desire the ability to reset the margins and "other fluff" away. So how to go about that?
Well, you provide solutions that help with it! For example, you can provide typographic CSS classes which also do common
resets to avoid some issues with cascade in the specific context of typography:

```css
:where(.text16Regular) {
	font-family: 'Our Sans Serif Of Choice', ui-sans-serif, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	font-size: 1rem;
	font-weight: 400;
	letter-spacing: 0;
	margin: 0;
}
```

The above is a very minimalistic example, but it does some useful resets. Not only do they get the desired typography
they get zero margins. Yet the specificity being `0, 0, 0` thanks to `:where()` it is also easy to override the margin
with another utility or by using custom CSS. Pure synergy as you have something that remains hugely compatible with
normalized CSS, or zero-class base CSS, or whatever you want to call it. You could even swap the base CSS with something
entirely different, or not provide it, and you remain more or less compatible with how browser styles behave by default.

You are embracing the default behavior of the browser which is familiar to anyone who has spent time learning CSS and
have fought the default. They know they exist, and by retaining them they are reminded they exist each time they are
restyling a semantic element. And that way it doesn't become alien in the same way that might happen on a resets based
system.

Of course there also needs to be a culture of embracing semantic HTML or you still end up with a div soup.

## State and variations

Buttons are a great example of an element that have a lot going for them. And oftentimes we wish to define custom hover,
focus, and active states on them. Oh and yes, there is disabled state too, but it isn't always the greatest option when
looking from screen reader accessibility perspective so you should probably not use it that much, if at all.

Defining a single set of button styles is easy enough, but what about the secondary, tertiary, or error buttons? What
about those buttons that look entirely different to regular buttons like circular close buttons? Or one off buttons that
need a reset but still need some of our regular button styles?

My solution for this issue was to create synergy: a reusable reset.

```css
:where(.button) {
	-webkit-appearance: none;
	appearance: none;
	display: inline-flex;
	gap: 0.5rem;
	flex: none;
	font-family: ui-sans-serif, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	font-size: 1.25rem;
	font-weight: 600;
	line-height: 1.25;
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	text-decoration: none;
	/* ... whatever else that is desired as baseline for all buttons... */
}

:where(.button):is(:link, :visited, :hover, :focus, :active) {
	/* if button style used on link then take the underline away */
	text-decoration: none;
	/* ... other desired baseline styles ... */
}
```

You could also call this different if desired, like `baseButton` or `buttonReset`. The point is that it does the reset
which makes it reusable for more than just a single one off button.

But a button without padding is not often what you want. So you need to expand upon this. If you stay with just vanilla
CSS one of the ways to go is to make use of data attributes. However in the tooling oriented world you also have the
option of using CSS Modules which has `composes`. It is really just a class name concat utility with a fancier name.
The advantage is that you can then more easily develop classes like `blueButton` or `smallBlueButton` which are easy
enough to import directly from the CSS module file for use.

But data attributes are also a nice way to go! And they are also easier to manage in a more vanilla CSS setting than
repeating all class name variations in the button reset style.

```css
:where(.button[data-button~='primary' i]) {
	background: blue;
	color: white;
}

:where(.button[data-button~='black' i]) {
	background: black;
	color: white;
}

:where(.button[data-button~='small' i]) {
	border-radius: 0.125rem;
	font-size: 0.875rem;
	padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem;
}

:where(.button[data-button~='medium' i]) {
	border-radius: 0.25rem;
	font-size: 1rem;
	padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem;
}

:where(.button[data-button~='circular' i]) {
	aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
	border-radius: 50%;
}
```

The above is one option for how to do a convenient utility on data attributes: allow for a space separated list. With
the above you can already do:

```html
<button class="button" type="submit" data-button="primary medium">Submit form</button>

<!-- usually you'd probably put in an icon instead -->
<button class="button" type="button" data-button="black circular">Big<br />circle!</button>
```

You can really craft these small utilities to work together! But it doesn't need to end there: what if you considered
allowing to mix both typography and button classes to exist together? The only issue is specificity: you'd need to make
sure that typography will be preferred over button's own typography no matter which order the styles are loaded. So that
would mean bumping specificity on typography one step higher, but might also mean bumping some button styles so that
desired things like padding are guaranteed to remain.

The benefit here is that these open up the option for some niche cases where maybe a designer has thought that a
monospace font would work better. And for that case you wouldn't need to create a new utility to button, instead just
use an appropriate monospace class from typography in the button and you're good to go. Synergy!

## Componentization

So far we've mostly looked at just the pure HTML and CSS, and tactics in how to make semantic HTML be an asset instead
of being a burden. However there is also the aspect of modern JavaScript tooling with view libraries and TypeScript.

The way I think about components, especially ones in a component library, is that they exist to provide convenience. And
that is also what TypeScript assists with: you get automatic suggestions for available options. Although that feature is
also available even without TypeScript, but usually you want to have bigger projects with types everywhere. It documents
things nicely.

However if we look at the earlier example where we had a `data-button` attribute with space separated list, there is one
problem with that: it is not easy to type! You **can** type it, of course, but space separated strings will quickly
become too complex to type as each new option increases valid values exponentially. Should we abandon the idea of space
separated lists?

No. We can keep that! What we instead need to consider is how to design a convenient API over a button. There are a few
things that people tend to like to do with a button:

1. Default to `type="button"` (native HTML button defaults to `type="submit"` = form submit bugs every so often).
2. Provide separate props for (color) variations, shapes, sizes.
3. Or boolean props.

This means you will have two different APIs: you have the CSS that is designed to work with HTML, or actually with any
web library, and then you have the component API which more or less hides the CSS API entirely, and might also hide some
of the HTML API as well. Like the example of `type="button"` above so that it doesn't need to be repeated so often.

With React we might end up with a component like this:

```tsx
import { type ComponentPropsWithoutRef } from 'react'

/* The empty strings exist to allow for intentional "not set" to opt-out of defaults. */
interface Props extends ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'button'> {
	variant?: '' | 'primary' | 'black'
	size?: '' | 'small' | 'medium'
	shape?: '' | 'circular'
}

export function Button({
	className = '',
	shape,
	size = 'medium',
	variant = 'primary',
	type = 'button',
	...props
}: Props) {
	const button = [shape, size, variant].filter((x) => x).join(' ') || undefined

	return <button {...props} className={`button ${className}`.trim()} data-button={button} type={type} />
}
```

This is a simplified example as in real life you probably need to allow for passing the ref as well at a minimum.

I didn't use boolean props here, because their technical implementation isn't as clean as just doing what can be done
with named props like `variant` and `size`. Or in other words: I find this synergy better.

The consumer side syntax difference to boolean props:

```tsx
/* boolean props */
<Button primary medium>
    Short!
</Button>

/* without boolean props */
<Button variant="primary" size="medium">
    Longer!
</Button>
```

I think there is an additional benefit of helping with the concepts when not using boolean props, but it seems like the
ultra short syntax allowed by boolean props has won in many component libraries.

You might have noticed that I used `ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'button'>` to allow all `button` styles to be passed
through. This enhances the options for using the Button component just like a native HTML button by providing all the
attributes if a developer so desires. So this is another form of synergy that can be allowed when you use a native HTML
button under the hood. Allowing everything doesn't always make sense for all components. But most of the time you do
want to provide hatches for at least `ref`, `className` and `style` at a minimum.

## Lessons learned

I hope this has helped to provide understanding on the value of synergy in web development, why some tools have a lack
of it, and how you can create more synergy by embracing it even in tools that are not optimal for the synergy.

In summary you should now know some basics on:

1. What is the value of semantic HTML and how to keep it easy to write it.
2. Existance and value of default base styles / normalized CSS / zero-class semantic CSS
3. How to build CSS utilities on top of the above, and how to allow their mixed use
4. Benefit of HTML data attributes
5. How and why to separate HTML & CSS API from a component API

This way of doing things is generally how I prefer to build modern websites. By staying close to HTML and CSS, and by
working from defaults and only overriding as necessary, I can have things that are more portable in the future and are
more quickly open to new future features that we keep on getting to HTML and CSS all the time. Frameworks like Tailwind
can't simply keep up with it, especially as some new features are such a big shift that they might not even be possible
to implement in a pure CSS utility mindset.

Of course this article is very incomplete as it is. I didn't cover CSS variables which you can also make part of the
synergy. This topic is very large as by it's nature it has to cover a wide variety of topics and technologies. The only
way you can get synergy is by learning the various technologies and what are the ideals of each of them.

For example, you need to consider usability / accessibility as they are an important part of what these technologies are used for, and HTML especially brings a lot for you out-of-the-box unless you ignore it and go for the div soup.

Whether this kind of thinking works for you is a different thing: maybe you prefer tools that let you go fast
immediately instead of spending some time for thinking a synergetic system. Or maybe you work in conditions that do not
allow for spending time outside of just pushing out more features. My own position is currently as a component library
maintainer and I've been given (or I've gained the trust) the freedom to spend time on it. This is a privilege that I
can acknowledge is not available for everyone.
