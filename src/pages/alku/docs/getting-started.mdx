# Getting started

Alku is a global stylesheet, that is: one CSS file. It can be used without a package manager.

<a href="https://www.unpkg.com/alku/index.css" download="alku.min.css" data-button="mediumSize canvasColor outline">
	<span>Download</span>
	<Icon href="/icons/download.svg" />
</a>

**Usage:**

-   [Via package manager](#via-package-manager)
-   [Importing in HTML](#importing-in-html)
-   [Personal preferences](#personal-preferences)
-   [Starter HTML](#starter-html)

## Via package manager

```bash
npm install alku --save-dev
pnpm install alku --save-dev
yarn add alku --save-dev
bun install alku --save-dev
```

Alku is just a global stylesheet so including it is easy enough in your main layout component:

```tsx
// import everything
import 'alku'

// or import normalization and essential utilities
import 'alku/alku.css'
```

## Importing in HTML

To get started quickly:

```html
<!-- everything minified -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.unpkg.com/alku/index.css" type="text/css" />
<!-- normalization and essentials minified -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.unpkg.com/alku/alku.css" type="text/css" />
```

In a more serious project you likely should host the files yourself.

## Personal preferences

This is a relatively common reset that is preferred by some teams or individuals:

```css
*,
::before,
::after {
	box-sizing: border-box;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

Alku does not do this, but you can include it on your site and it will not do harm to Alku's styles.

How is this possible?

1. Alku avoids setting widths and heights combined with padding or border.
2. If a specific `box-sizing` is required it will be set with a higher than zero specificity.

For example almost all form elements have been specified without a height or width, yet they have visual consistency and
are of the same default height regardless of browser.

## Starter HTML

The following source includes some recommended basic page structure.

Note: the HTML tags here have "self-closing" slash even though that is not necessary as per HTML spec. These can be
omitted, but are included here for the sake of clarity (= "this element has no closing tag").

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
		<title>Hello world!</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.unpkg.com/alku/index.css" type="text/css" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="link-to-external-site" hidden>Link to external site, opens a new window</div>
		<a data-text="visuallyHidden" href="#main">Jump to content</a>

		<header><!-- optional --></header>

		<main id="main">
			<h1>Hello world!</h1>
			<p>
				External link sample:
				<a
					href="https://vesa.piittinen.name/alku"
					aria-describedby="link-to-external-site"
					rel="noopener noreferrer"
					target="_blank"
				>
					Alku
				</a>
			</p>
		</main>

		<footer><!-- optional --></footer>
	</body>
</html>
```

Random tip: going for minimalism? You can omit `<head />` and `<body />`! They're automatically added in when missing.

### Pointers

1. Remember to define page language in the `<html />` tag!
2. Skip link is not necessary if you don't have a lot of stuff before the main content.
3. Skip link can be styled! Just add a `class`, style it as per usual, and you can focus to the element with keyboard.
4. Skip link's style should have `position: absolute;` so you avoid content shift.
5. You may omit external link solution if you have your own. It is highly recommended to signal external links, with
   descriptive text included!

For favicon you may find <Link href="https://realfavicongenerator.net">RealFaviconGenerator</Link> a nice service even
if you adjust the end result later on (provide more optimized images etc.).

### Metadata

For meta and social media the minimum you likely want to have:

```html
<meta name="title" content="Page title" />
<meta name="description" content="Page description." />

<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.example.com" />
<meta property="og:title" content="Page title" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Page description." />
<meta property="og:image" content="/social_2024x1012.jpg?v=0" />
<meta property="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
```

The social image can be heavily optimized and compressed. It can probably be smaller than <code>2024&times;1012</code>,
but should retain the 2 to 1 ratio. Note that the image may be clipped so you should not put any important text too
close to the left and right edges!

If you make a mistake with the social image you can increase the number after `?v=` to eventually see the image update in
caches. Using a search parameter is a cache busting technique.
