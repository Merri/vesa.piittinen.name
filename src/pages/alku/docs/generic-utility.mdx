# Generic utility

`data--` is a tiny helper utility.

<div data-grid="" data-scrolling="inline">

| Value           | Description                                                                                        |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `newRow`        | Place item to first column in a grid. `grid-column: 1;`                                            |
| `fullRow`       | Place item to all columns in a grid. `grid-column: 1 / -1;`                                        |
| `max100%`       | Limit maximum width to 100%. `max-inline-size: 100%;`                                              |
| `100%`          | Set width to 100%. `inline-size: 100%;`                                                            |
| `bottom`        | `vertical-align: bottom;`                                                                          |
| `middle`        | `vertical-align: middle;`                                                                          |
| `top`           | `vertical-align: top;`                                                                             |
| `cover::before` | Position invisible cover absolutely over the top of the container using `::before` pseudo element. |
| `cover::after`  | Position invisible cover absolutely over the top of the container using `::after` pseudo element.  |
| `focus`         | Show focus indicator (unless a child element has focus).                                           |
| `focus::before` | Relocate focus indicator to `::before` pseudo element.                                             |
| `focus::after`  | Relocate focus indicator to `::after` pseudo element.                                              |
| `focusInside`   | Change focus offset to show focus indicator inside the element.                                    |
| `focusInside`   | Change focus offset to show focus indicator outside the element.                                   |

</div>

As can be seen the first ones could be written to `style` attribute. These exist in this utility for being commonly
needed, and to be possibly easier to remember as part of the utility.

## Creating a card

You can use the cover and focus features to create cards that are clickable from everywhere despite link being only a
single item within card!

<div
	data-color="contrast"
	data-box="column"
	style="border-radius: 12px; gap: 8px; padding: 16px; position: relative; width: 12rem;"
>
	<h3 data-text="semibold 20">This is my card</h3>
	<p data-text="14">There are things here.</p>
	<a href="#creating-a-card" data--="cover::before focus::before focusInside">
		<span>Clickaroo!</span>
	</a>
</div>

```html
<div
	data-color="contrast"
	data-box="column"
	style="border-radius: 12px; gap: 8px; padding: 16px; position: relative; width: 12rem;"
>
	<h3 data-text="semibold 20">This is my card</h3>
	<p data-text="14">There are things here.</p>
	<a href="#creating-a-card" data--="cover::before focus::before focusInside">Clickaroo!</a>
</div>
```

Notice how focus indicator appears inside the card, and the whole card reacts to hover and clicking, and you do have the
expected keyboard focus behavior.

As for the cards it makes more sense to write them using `class`, not via utilities and `style` attribute.

## Focus

`data--="focus"` is mostly useful as an additional development aid.

<button data--="focus" type="button">
	<span>I always indicate focus</span>
</button>
